Package is an Angular library used for easier integration with [`Rhetos`](https://github.com/Rhetos), DSL
framework that enables you to create your own domain-specific language to build server
applications.

It implements several services for data access and metadata by complementing
`Rhetos.FloydExtensions`, a DSL plugin module that includes model generator and Rest endpoint for
fetching model metadata.
